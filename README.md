# Movie Recommender System

## Overview
The Movie Recommender System is a machine-learning project that aims to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their viewing history, ratings, and preferences. This system utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation techniques to suggest movies that users are likely to enjoy.

## Technologies Used
The project is implemented using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data processing, modelling, and evaluation. The recommendation engine leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze user behaviour and movie features to generate accurate recommendations.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset of user-movie interactions and movie metadata for training and evaluating the recommendation model. The dataset is not included in this repository due to size limitations, but a sample dataset can be obtained from [[source link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)].

## Usage
To use the Movie Recommender System, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the project documentation. The system provides a user-friendly interface for users to input their preferences and receive personalized movie recommendations.

# Notice
There is no similarity.pkl file in the repository. Run the movie recommender system.ipynb program to load the similarity.pkl file, then run the app.py program to make predictions.
